Only files in the "complete" folder will be checked by the bot.

Name files `boss-name.md`, all lowercase and with hyphens instead of spaces.

Note that the preview on Github **will not necessarily look the same** as the messages posted to Discord.

The bot will automatically remove multiple line breaks, and add a link to the top at the end of the channel. Hyperlinks on their own line with no other writing will be posted as individual messages. 

Some markdown is compatible with discord: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-

To keep links un-embedded, surround them with <>, e.g. `<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki>`
