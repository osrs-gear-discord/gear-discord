# Advice/Info

## Gear advice
- Book of law is an Arma item as Masori does not provide protection against Arma's troops. Drop them inside, or keep it so you can safely resupply outside. If you don't have Masori and bring Armadyl, you don't need this item.
- Shield slot: DFW/Twisted buckler → Elysian spirit shield → Dragonfire shield → Crystal shield
- Chinchompa quantity: Bring ~6 times the amount of chins per assigned Aviansie e.g. a task of 200 Aviansies requires roughly 1.2k Black chinchompas. Bring about 30 chins per Kree'arra kill off-task e.g. 3k chins for 100 boss kills.
- Secondary weapon for the main: Twisted bow with Dragon arrows → Best crossbow with Dragon diamond bolts → Any crossbow with Adamant diamond bolts. Twisted bow is definitely not vital.
- Cape: Max cape (should be replaced with a Fletching cape if you're not maxed) provides a grapple and crossbow while only using 1 inventory slot. Another benefit of using these capes is equipping them for their defence and prayer bonuses for the first few kills of the trip until you receive the desired food drops.

## Kill count
- Using Ecumenical keys for Armadyl is the highest priority boss to use them at. However, killing Spirital creatures in the Armadyl camp is a good alternative if you can trap the Gorak that wanders around there. 

## During kills
- It's recommended to firstly chin off the ranged minion then the melee minion in order to get the fastest kills possible. If you mess up the process of holding Kree'arra in line with the ranged minion, it is also fine to then just chin the melee minion followed by the mage minion instead.
- At the start of the trip you should do the normal method to avoid as much damage as possible. With this method you prevent Kree'arra from melee'ing you (and by proxy, prevent Kree'arra from moving) by attacking the minion on your attack tick, then targeting Kree'arra while your attack is on cooldown (2 ticks). It's important that Kree attacks on the two ticks you are on cooldown, otherwise it can melee you still.
- Later on, when you get an excess amount of food, you can afk chin the minion while 1t flicking to minimize the prayer usage whilst tanking Kree's melee hits (not recommended if you don't have max gear).
- When you have both an excess amount of prayer and food, you can even AFK for the rest of your task.

## Potion advice
- Use the bastion potions slowly till you get a boosting potion drop. The crystal dusts are then to make Divine ranging potions to maximize your DPS. Either make Divine super defence, use regular super defences or use brews when you run out of bastions. You need at least one method of keeping your def level buffed.
- Try to conserve the bastion potions as 8 divine bastion doses isn't enough to get a range potion drop if you go through them quickly. Turn the remaining potions into divine bastion potions as soon as you have a sufficient amount of range pot drops.
