You can disable in the "unlock" section of slayer rewards at the bottom, costs 0 points to enable and disable. 

## Setup
There are a few extra task-specific items you will need sometimes:
- Lockpick
- Wilderness sword
- Super antifire potion
- Revenant cave teleport or Annakarl teletab
- Dueling rings
- Burning Amulet
- Wilderness crab teleport

All extra items are noted below, with the task locations.

You should swap out the Ava's Assembler for a Max Cape if you have it. This way you always have the Slayer Cape perk and infinite house teleports.

# Advice/Info
Wilderness Slayer is by far the best method to gain points, with a specific blocklist you can get close to 300 points per hour. The exact amount of points you get per hour will depend on your effort put in per task and gear. Craw's Bow is a huge upgrade over blowpipe.

You should disable Aviansies and Boss Tasks before doing wilderness slayer; if you have them unlocked they'll have a negative impact on your pts/hr. 

Optional: You can bring a Slayer/Max cape for the 1/10 chance of repeating the same task if it's a good one. You can also replace the construction cape with a max cape if you don't mind risking Slayer Helm.

For efficiency, you should switch out Webweaver bow for Toxic blowipe on a few tasks: Chaos Druids, Dark Warriors, Earth Warriors, Ice Warriors, Magic Axes, Rogues

## Blocked Tasks
You don’t actually need to block tasks but blocking the worst tasks increases pts/hr drastically. These are:
- Black Demons
- Greater Demons (If you don't block, do them)
- Fire Giants
This is only 3/7 block spaces. Other undesirable tasks are a much lower weighting, so it's not worth it to dedicate them a spot on your block list.
- Bears
- Spiritual Creatures (These are very optional, if you want a full slayer blocklist add them as skipping them is 17 pts/hr less)

## Skip Tasks
These tasks are significantly longer than the others so it is worthwhile to skip these. Obviously you don’t have to skip the ones you have blocked.
- Black Demons
- Fire Giants
- Spiritual Creatures (you can do these if you want Ecumenical Keys) 
- Revenant
- Green Dragon (Only affects pts/hr by 7 if you skip)
- Lava Dragon
- Bloodvelds
- Moss Giants

If you would like to work out exactly how many points an hour you would get with your personalised blocklist and how quickly you personally complete a task you can use this spreadsheet originally created by Jaffar and updated and cleaned up by myself & Koekenpan; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16kOgrutbe_fiPguvYOTfEBHtrhR6DHZw8L_wNZSSvJA/
