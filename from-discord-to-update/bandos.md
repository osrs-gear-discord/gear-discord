Take note of the specific blessings used in all setups as well as the gear. You want to have 1 Zamorak item and 1 Bandos item in order to mitigate damage outside the boss room.

Tank Info
● Replace the Elysian Spirit Shield with a Dragonfire Shield if you're tanking and don't have an Elysian Spirit Shield.
● Replace the Justiciar armour set with a Guthan's Helm + Karil's Leathertop + Bandos Tassets if you're tanking and don't have Justiciar armour. 
● While using a Shadow on the attacker, the tank does not need to bring a defence draining Special Attack so you can just use an SGS for sustain. If you're attacking with ranged/melee, bringing DWH+Avernic+Inq top+Inq skirt is the better choice for total kills per hour. Otherwise, if you only want to do a small switch, the Bandos Godsword would be the better Special Attack weapon. The difference however is very minimal (less than a second per kill).

Attacker Info
● The Shadow setup is simply better. The Volatile is used for specs, the Kodai is used for Blood Barraging minion stacks for hp, the Sang is used to attacking non-grouped minions/getting KC.
