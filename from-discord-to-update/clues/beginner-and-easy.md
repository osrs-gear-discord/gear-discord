# Advice / Info
- It is highly recommended to fill up your bank with bank fillers and the loot of Young impling jars while having no place holders for the bottom 9 items in the inventory. This way you can quickly withdraw 9-10 jars, open them and bank everything without having to withdraw big stacks of items again.
- If you don't want to do both types of clues in parallel, just bank the clue you're not interesting in doing and only gear up for the other type. You don't have to change anything about the setup.
You can change young implings for gourmet implings if you only want to do easies.
- If you get Beginner hot/cold steps, you can follow this guide for the fastest way to find the dig spot:
