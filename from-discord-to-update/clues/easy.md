Advice/Info
It is highly recommended to fill up your bank with bank fillers and the loot of Gourmet impling jars while having no place holders of the Teleport tabs, Dust runes and Rune pouch. This way you can quickly withdraw 10 jars, open them and bank everything without having to withdraw big stacks of items again.

It is also recommended to have the 9 other items in your inventory close to each other in a bank. Other items that are useful are shown in this image: https://i.imgur.com/8juT8SE.png
For the cape slot: Max cape > Construct. cape > Crafting cape + Teleport to house tablets in your inventory > Any of the capes in the image above
