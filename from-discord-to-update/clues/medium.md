# Advice/Info
It is highly recommended to fill up your bank with bank fillers and the loot of Eclectic impling jars while having no place holders of the Teleport tabs, Soul runes and Rune pouch. This way you can quickly withdraw 10 jars, open them and bank everything without having to withdraw big stacks of items again.

If you don't have an Achievement diary cape, substitute it with the Steel key ring.

It is also recommended to have the other items in your inventory close to each other in your bank (or use a bank tag). Other items that are useful are shown below:

For the cape slot: Max cape → Construct. cape → Crafting cape + Teleport to house tablets in your inventory → Any of the capes in Setup 1

Incase you need inventory slots, there are a couple of items that cover only 2 medium steps. These items can be replaced for a Teleport to house tablet. If you aren't maxed keep in mind that Fishing cape and Hunter cape can be used for their teleports as well.

Make sure you have at least 4 inventory spaces, so you don't have to juggle.

This spreadsheet by Kelvino shows you the closest teleports to a certain step:
