Advice/Info
With gear like this, it doesn't really matter what you do. Claw twice, then switch to mage gear for the most DPS. You can use a Dragon dagger for your special attack weapon if you lack Dragon claws. Alternatively, just Scything it is fine as well.

Dodge the candy attack, pray melee against Mimic or kite it while praying against the minions if you struggle to outdps Mimic.
