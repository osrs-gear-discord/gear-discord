# Advice/Info

## Attacker Info

The Shadow setup is simply better. The Volatile is used for specs, the Kodai is used for Blood Barraging minion stacks for hp, the Sang is used to attacking non-grouped minions/getting KC. 
If using Bow of Faerdhinen setup, you can swap to Arceuus spellbook once comfortable with offticking and flicking minions after the boss is dead - swap out

## Tank Info
- Replace the Elysian Spirit Shield with a Dragonfire Shield if you're tanking and don't have an Elysian Spirit Shield.
- Replace the Justiciar armour set with a Guthan's Helm + Karil's Leathertop + Bandos Tassets if you're tanking and don't have Justiciar armour. 
- While using a Shadow on the attacker, the tank does not need to bring a defence draining Special Attack so you can just use an SGS for sustain. If you're attacking with ranged/melee, bringing DWH+Avernic+Inq top+Inq skirt is the better choice for total kills per hour. Otherwise, if you only want to do a small switch, the Bandos Godsword would be the better Special Attack weapon. The difference however is very minimal (less than a second per kill).
