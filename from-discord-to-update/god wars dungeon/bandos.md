# Advice/Info

## Attacker Info
- The Shadow setup is simply better. Volatile staff is for specs on the boss, Kodai wand is for Blood Barraging minion stacks for hp, Sang staff is for getting KC/attacking non-grouped minions. 
- If using Bow of Faerdhinen setup, you can swap to Arceuus spellbook once comfortable with offticking and flicking minions after the boss is dead

## Tank Info
- Replace the Elysian Spirit Shield with a Dragonfire Shield if you're tanking and don't have an Elysian Spirit Shield.
- Replace the Justiciar armour set with a Guthan's Helm + Karil's Leathertop + Bandos Tassets if you're tanking and don't have Justiciar armour. 
- While using a Shadow on the attacker, the tank does not need to bring a defence draining Special Attack so you can just use an SGS for sustain. If you're attacking with ranged/melee, bringing DWH+Avernic+Inq top+Inq skirt is the better choice for total kills per hour. Otherwise, if you only want to do a small switch, the Bandos Godsword would be the better Special Attack weapon. The difference however is very minimal (less than a second per kill).
