# Advice/Info
## Getting KC
- Take note of the specific blessings and gear used in all setups. You need 1 zamorak item (and 1 saradomin item if you intend to get KC in the main area - only if you're doloing). 
- KCing in the main area VS in the Zamorak chamber are very similar in speed if your method in the Zamorak chamber is to kill the 2 eastern imps and hop worlds. 

## Tank Advice
- Replace the Elysian Spirit Shield with a Dragonfire Shield if you're tanking and don't have an Elysian Spirit Shield.
- Replace the Justiciar armour set with a Serpentine Helm + Bandos Chestplate + Bandos Tassets if you're tanking and don't have Justiciar armour. If you do this, you also DO NOT need any Antidotes. 
- Some players may prefer to just replace every Super restore in the Attacker's and Tank's inventories with Sanfew serums to save inventory space, but the Antidote++ option is significantly cheaper. Each Antidote++ will provide 48 minutes of protection.

## Attacker Advice
- Divine potions are good to use if you have a re-supply alt, otherwise you need to use regular potions in order to do a full task in 1 trip.

## Melee Solo Advice
- The setup focuses on flicking the minions, using Protect from Melee when K'ril attacks and maximising your mage defence.
- If you're not flicking the minions, take the same setup but take less Supercombats, less Sanfew serums and a lot more food. Exact food:potion ratios vary for different people, so use 1 Super combat and 4 Sanfew serums as a base then adjust to your needs.
- If you don't intend to shield flick, bank the Elysian.
