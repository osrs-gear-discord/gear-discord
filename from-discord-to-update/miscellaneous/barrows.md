Advice/Info
● Barrows is a common way of hunting elite clue scrolls. With this setup, you can do 24+ chests/hr which puts the elite rate at just around 1.5 hours (1/33.75 with all 6 brothers slain. 1/32 with Elite CAs)
● RuneLite has a Barrows Brothers plugin that can be helpful for solving puzzles, tracking which brothers you've killed, and a Prayer Drain Timer
● Use your Dragon Claw specs on Karil.
● Blowpipe Ahrim.
● If you don't have Ancestral then don't bother bringing any replacement magic robes (wear torva).
● If your inventory is consistently overfilling, bank the Ancestral hat and Imbued God cape and camp the Torva helm and Infernal cape.
● If you strictly want elites and don't value gp then you can bank the Salve Amulet (ei) since this is only used for killing skeletons. The best replacement would be a Torva Platebody.
● If you want gp alongside your elite hunting, you can kill any of these combinations while running to the center of the crypt to obtain the optimal reward percentage for gp/hr. This means you will also never get bolt racks which is why there is no bolt rack placeholder.

● With 99 prayer you should never run out of prayer points during a run, however if you are lower prayer or having prayer troubles, it would be recommended to bank a Ranging Potion in favour of a Prayer Potion.
