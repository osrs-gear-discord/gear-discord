Advice/Info
● Use Saradomin Brews to overheal whenever your Divine Potions expire.

Mechanics
● After you deal 50 damage to them, they will switch their overhead to the attack style you last used. 

● After they hit 3 0's on you with a specific combat style they will switch randomly to another combat style. You can predict all but one style change:

3 0's with mage/range → step back → if it walks towards you, it switched to melee

3 0's with mage/range → step back → if it doesn't walk towards you, it switched to the other style

3 0's with melee → cannot predict mage/range as it is a 50/50 chance → always Protect from Magic since your range defence is much higher

Weapons
● Arclight → Ghrazi Rapier → Blade of Saeldor → Abyssal Tentacle → Abyssal Whip
● For ranged weapons, a Toxic Blowpipe is technically the best DPS, but this means you will only have 2 ticks to do your full melee gear switch and activate piety. Over time, a Twisted Bow will lose you less time than a Toxic Blowpipe since it gives you 5 ticks to do this switch, and therefore wins in longterm DPS.
● Typical melee special attacks such as Dragon Claws and DDS are bad here since the subsequent hitsplats will null if the first hitsplat pushes the Gorilla over the 50 damage prayer-switch threshold. If you don't have an SGS, simply use the Toxic Blowpipe special attack, or just the Arclight if you're using a Twisted Bow.
