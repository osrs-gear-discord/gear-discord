# Advice/Info
The flowers must be killed before you can damage Hespori. These spawn at the start, at 66.6% (200 hp) and 33.3% (100 hp).
Any 2t ranging weapon can reach the four flowers without losing attack ticks. All attacks on the flower will 1 hit it, so use the cheapest 2t ranging weapon option you can use. When you fire the last dart to kill, you have to wait an extra tick on top of your 2t weapon before Hespori can be damaged.
It's weak to slash.
Crystal halberd can be used for speed kills to skip the last set of flowers. You can teleport to your POH when you fail to do so, so you can try multiple times a day.
Switch to your Farmer's outfit before harvesting Hespori if you have it, and replant the seed.
