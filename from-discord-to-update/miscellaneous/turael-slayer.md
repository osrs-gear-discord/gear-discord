# Advice/Info
If you prefer afking most tasks, it may be beneficial to bring another ranging potion in place of the second stamina.

__If you don't own a max cape:__
- Replace it with a construction cape (or teleport to house tabs). 
- Replace the royal seed pod with some form of light source (and use the duel arena gnome glider instead). 
- If you have a slayer cape you should also take this along by replacing the Xeric's talisman if you have one mounted in your POH, or just replace an expeditious bracelet.

__If you don't have a diary cape:__
- Replace Lassar and Draynor manor teleport tabs for Steam and Law runes, replace the Air runes for Dust runes. Use Spellbook swap to Standard for Lumbridge and Varrock teleports, spellbook swap to Ancients for Lassar and to Arceuus for Draynor Manor.
- Replace the Diary cape for a Xeric's talisman.

Using Turael as a slayer master has 2 primary purposes:
- Hunting a desirable task from a higher tier slayer master quickly. This is done by getting a slayer task from a master such as Duradel. If the task is undesirable, you cancel the task with Turael and do a Turael task instead. Then try your luck with Duradel again. Repeat this until you get the task you want. (WARNING: THIS WILL RESET YOUR TASK STREAK TO ZERO)
Note: If you get a big Kalphite task from a high level master (Duradel/Steve) it cannot be skipped with Turael as he also has this task on his table. If you don't want to kill KQ, it's recommended to have Kalphites blocked while Turael skipping.
- Boosting slayer points by doing 9 tasks from Turael then every 10th from your highest tier slayer master. This will net you around 200 points/hr if you use Duradel. However this is somewhat redundant now since wilderness slayer exists and is better points/hr. 

The method revolves around using NPC contact to receive slayer tasks from both Turael and your chosen slayer master. The inventory setup allows you to do any Turael task without needing to bank for specific items. It is highly recommended to create a bank tab using the info found in ⁠bank-tags to speed up your ability to gear up.
