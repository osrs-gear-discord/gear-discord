Setup
There are a few extra task specific Items you will need sometimes;
Lockpick
Wilderness Sword
Super Antifire
Rev Cave teles or Annakarl Tabs.
Dueling rings 
Burning Amulets
Dark crab teleports
All of the extra items are noted with the spots to do tasks, below.
You should swap out the Ava's Assembler for a Max Cape if you have it. This way you always have the Slayer Cape perk and infinite house teleports.

Advice/Info
Wilderness Slayer is by far the best method to gain points, with a specific blocklist you can get close to 300 points per hour. The exact amount of points you get per hour will depend on your effort put in per task and gear. Craw's Bow is a huge upgrade over blowpipe.

You should disable Aviansies and Boss Tasks before doing wilderness slayer, if you have them unlocked they'll have a negative impact on your pts/hr. 

Optional  You can bring a Slayer/Max cape for the 1/10 chance of repeating the same task if it's a good one. You can also replace the construction cape with a max cape if you don't mind risking Slayer Helm.

For efficiency, you should switch out Craws bow for Blowipe (addy) on a few tasks, those being Chaos Druid, Earth Warrior, Ice Warrior, Magic Axes, Dark Warrior and Rogues

Blocked Tasks
You don’t actually need to block tasks but blocking the worst tasks increases pts/hr drastically. These are:
- Black Demons
- Greater Demons (If you don't have blocked, do them)
- Fire Giants
This is only 3/6 block spaces but other undesirable tasks are a much lower weighting so it's not worth it to dedicate them a spot on your block list.
- Bears
- Spiritual Creatures (These are very optional, if you want a full slayer blocklist add them as skipping them is 17 pts/hr less)

Skip Tasks
These tasks are significantly longer than the others so it is worthwhile to skip these. Obviously you don’t have to skip the ones you have blocked.
- Black Demons
- Fire Giants
- Spiritual Creatures (you can do these if you want Ecumenical Keys) 
- Revenant
- Green Dragon (Only affects pts/hr by 7 if you skip)
- Lava Dragon
- Bloodvelds
- Moss Giants
