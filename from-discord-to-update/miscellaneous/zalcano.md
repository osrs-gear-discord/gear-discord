# Advice/Info
Loot scales with your personal damage contribution to the kill. Therefore, masses are very bad for profit. 4 man teams seem to be the sweetspot for gp/hr.

Massing (e.g. on world 375 or 378) is best for hunting the pet.

## Setup Overview
- Divine rune pouch/Rune pouch: This is for storing runes that you get as loot from the boss.
- Teleport crystal: This is for returning quickly to Zalcano in the event of a death (doesn't have to be an Eternal crystal, just a regular one is fine).
- Celestial signet: This ring provides a 10% chance of saving charges when using crystal equipment and boosts your mining level by 4 (an Elven Signet can also be used if you don't have a Celestial Signet, but you will not receive the invisible +4 mining boost).
- Regen bracelet: 2x HP regen (4x overall HP regen if stacked with Hitpoints Cape or Max Cape).
- Varrock armour 1-4: 10% chance to get 2x ores.
- Phoenix necklace: Very useful for saving you if you misclick under Zalcano when she's fallen, or if you run through red symbols by accident.
- Elysian spirit shield: Damage reduction if hit by boulders. Just go without an off-hand if you don't own one, or see next bulletpoint.
- If you're not 99 Mining, you should take some prayer bonus in the form of a God Book, bBlessing and maybe a god stole or Holy wraps if you're confident with your HP conservation. This is so that you can pray Preserve the entire time to prolong your mining boost from your pickaxe's Special Attack.
- Ghommal's lucky penny: Obtained as a reward from completing the Master tier of Combat Achievements and worn in the ammunition slot, it provides a 5% chance of saving a crystal or infernal pickaxe charge. When worn with a Celestial signet, they both roll independently at a chance to save a crystal charge.

### Downgrades
- Max cape → Mining cape → Hitpoints cape → Graceful cape
- Regen bracelet → Graceful gloves
- Celestial signet → Elven signet → Lightbearer → Ring of the gods (i) → Ring of suffering (i)
- Crystal pickaxe → Dragon/Infernal pickaxe
- Divine rune pouch → Rune pouch

## Killing Zalcano
1. Mine the glowing red rocks (you mine these much faster than the non-glowing ones). For teams with 4-10 people, divide 30 by the amount of people in your team to get a rough estimate of how many rocks each player should mine.
2. Refine your newly acquired ore on the furnace.
3. Run across the room and imbue your refined ore on the altar.
4. Throw the imbued ore at Zalcano. If blue circles appear, run onto one immediately and continue throwing. If blue circles don't appear, throw them until you have a few left then wait for blue circles to appear and throw the rest.
5. When her shield reaches zero she will fall to the ground where you mine her to deal damage.

### Zalcano's Attacks
- She will periodically drop boulders from the sky, they cover 1 tile and deal ~40 damage. Dodge these.
- She will lay down patterns of demonic symbols. AVOID THE RED SYMBOLS, they deal damage ranging from 0 up to 30 very rapidly and drain your run energy. STAND ON THE BLUE SYMBOLS as they increase your damage when you throw your imbued ore.
- Rubble will occasionally fall on all players dealing small amounts of damage (~0-6). This is unavoidable. 
- Zalcano will throw an orange attack at the glowing red rock, causing it to explode and another rock will glow instead. This will deal 20+ damage if you're standing next to the rock as it explodes. This attack commonly happens very soon after Zalcano gets up after falling.
- Zalcano will lash out at all nearby players after she gets up after falling. This will deal ~10 damage but is easy to avoid by just moving away when the mining phase is over.
- Standing under her during the mining phase will damage you heavily for 20-40 damage per tick.
- Not an attack but worth noting: she will throw a red orb somewhere random which spawns a golem - throw your imbued ore at it and when it dies (14 health) it can drop 20-24 imbued ore (this is effective in small groups. In masses you can ignore the golem). The golem walks towards Zalcano and will heal her shield by 50 if it reaches her.
