# Advice/Info

## Speedrun Tips
- Uncharge shadow for souls to use death charge. 11-13 charges should be enough for the full run.
- Can replace cape with imbued heart. This only works if you don't brew.
- Thralls let you 1 hit melee fremennik with this setup. Always start waves with thralls up.
- Prepot divine super combat, ranging, heart (macing up prayer optional)
- DWH saves between 8 (1 hammer) to 12 seconds (2 hammers) at Sol
- Venator when possible. Venator ring (full range bis) gives a max of 91 instead of 88, making it bis.
- Flick early waves so you can sustain later waves.
- Avoid blessing with quiver unless you want to always equip quiver before venator/twisted bow.
### Downgrades:
- remove masori/venator ring. if not taking ultor your scythe maxes <50 on first hit, so use sgs for ranger.
- Ring of shadows can be used to smuggle runes for veng/sbs/thrall/deathcharge: take lava, astral, cosmic in pouch in this case.
### Wave solves
- Prioritize skipping wave 2 & 4 or 3 (not enough time for clawing todo all unless sbs veng thrall death charge)
- Divine potting is situational. In later waves, prioritize having bastion at the start rather than scb because you want to be able to murk pre-backup
- Use 2 tiles east of b5 tile for no-damage start. Run NW pillar after 5 ticks of clicking start.
- Backups start at 39.6s since wave start. Use Colosseum plugin to keep track of current wave time.
- If back up includes a Serpent Shaman, always prepare to off-tick with any other NPC that may be alive. Max setups reduce the chances of this occuring due to faster TTK.
- If bad stack (e.g. mage manticore front ranger at the back), prioritize manticores first so you can flick ranger after.
- If low on prayer, focus on manticores above other monsters.
- If killing a monster simplifies the stack and is relatively squishy (shaman>mager>ranger>manticore...) dps it down first.
- Always prioritize using venator over Scythe if you can 3-hit (unless you need healing).
- If only 2 3x3 npcs (assuming you're west of NW pillar), 
 - stand in middle of the pillar and run south from the middle of the pillar to offtick such that back NPC attacks first
 - stand in middle + 1/2 tiles west of mid pillar and run south to offtick such athat front NPC attacks first.
- if 3 3x3 NPCs (assuming you're west of NW pillar):
 - you can run all the way to the westernmost tile of NW pillar-adjacent boundary before pillar swapping to avoid the 3rd NPC immediately attacking (because magers/rangers/manticore range is 15 tiles).
**Venator bow bounces**
- Cannot venator 3x3 and 3x3: skip during wave 7-9.
- Use Venator when:
 - Shaman South or West
 - Jaguar north or east
**Invo Picks**
- Never: Bees, Totemic
- Avoid unless you know what you're doing: Red flag (unless comfortable off-ticking), Doom 3, Relentless 2, 3, Mantimayhem 3
- Avoid before wave 10: reentry 1/2
- Dynamic duo adds between 18-90s depending on when it's taken
**Sol Heredit**
- Prioritize: Location > Prayer > Health.
- After second lightning, rotate to East/West of Sol so that your moves are never affected by flare. Post that, can rotate based on where the acid is.
- Always keep Sol fully visible so you can see grapple overheads.
- If you can grapple right as sol is pulling your equipment, your next hit will always max.
- Lightning does NOT reset spear/shield attack cycles.
- For Parry, don't use audio cues (as it changes past 50%), instead, look out for when the sparkles disappear into the spear tip.

**DPS Info**
__Venator is always better when you can triple hit__

Serpent Shamans:
8 way bp > (~1t) 6 way bp > (~1t) 8 way tbow > (~1t) 6 way tbow > (9t) scy
Jaguar
8 way bp > (~1t) 6 way bp > (~1t) Scy > (12t) tbow
Javelin/Manticore
scythe > tbow > bp
if maneuvering into melee distance takes < 5ticks, its worth
Shockwave
scythe > 6 way bp > 8 way tbow > 6 way tbow > 6 way bp
Minotaur
tbow on spawn if you cannot reach.
