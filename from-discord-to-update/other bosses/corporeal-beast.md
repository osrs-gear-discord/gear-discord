#Advice/Info
## Downgrades
If you don't have Inquisitor's, you bring the Dwarven helmet for the Dragon warhammer special attacks. You just camp the Masori or Karils pieces instead of the Inquisitor's hauberk and plateskirt. Any piece you can get is helpful.

Downgrade to Zamorakian spear if you don't have the Osmumten's fang. 

### Dragon Claws vs Crystal Halberd and Osmumten's fang vs Zamorakian spear
It takes around 8 DWH specs before the Crystal Halberd becomes competitive with Dragon Claws. Usually in small teams you only aim to land around 3-4 DWH specs before killing the boss so Dragon Claws will be better (if you even bother taking a DPS spec - it's usually better to just land 3 hammers and kill it unless you're 2+2ing). In solos where you spec Corp's def all the way to 0, the Crystal Halberd is better.
Similarly, Osmumten's fang is better than Zamorakian spear all the way until 19 defence, the equivalent of 3 DWH hammers and 107 BGS damage. 

## 3+ man team method
Use the duo setup, except remove the cannonballs and the Arclight as these aren't used.
- Hit 3 total DWH specs as a team
- If you land enough specs, just stay in the room and kill it
- If not, Poh -> restore spec -> try again

## Duo/2+2 method
- Hit 3 total DWH specs as a team
- Lure it to the entrance (lure spot shown below)
- Enter from that square, use all BGS specs and kill. Don't POH if you miss the BGS specs.

### Alt options for 2+2
**Twisted Bow**
+/- Does ~300 damage per kill (vs ~500 of spear alt) but has no snipe potential
+ Barely has to eat due to standing far away and having high mage def
+ Doesn't require dupe gear (2 spears, 2 tortures, 2 prims, 2 DWH etc.)
+ Never steals core aggro
+ More AFK

**Zamorakian Spear Alt**
+ Speeds up the speccing process by speccing on 4 accounts instead of 2
+/- Does ~500 damage per kill (but you have to watch damage to avoid snipes)
- Has to eat more often due to tanking melee attacks
- Can aggro the core
- Requires dupe gear (2 spears, 2 tortures, 2 prims, 2 DWH etc.)

## Spec numbers for soloing (getting all his stats to 0)
3 DWH specs → 20 Arclight specs → 200 BGS damage
