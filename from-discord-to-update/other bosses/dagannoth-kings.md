Advice/Info

Gear advice
● Melee weapon: Scythe of vitur → Inquisitor's mace → Ghrazi rapier → Abyssal tentacle
● Ranged weapon: Twisted bow → Toxic blowpipe
● If you use a Toxic blowpipe, take Pegasian boots instead of Primordials. This is to prevent situations where you have to deal with both Supreme and Prime aggroing you at the same time. If you're confident with dealing with them, camp the Primordial boots.
● Cape switch isn't necessary if you don't have an Infernal cape, but the Fire cape still a really good switch to have.
● The more mage switches you can bring (Ancestral) the better, as the Tumeken's shadow heavily favours magic damage bonuses. It does require you to flick more often or use a resupply alt.
● If you're using an item that provides passive healing (Sanguinesti staff, Blood fury) you can consider forgoing a rune pouch altogether for an extra supply spot since all spellbooks are quite weak at DKS. If you're using a resupply alt you could even consider thralls.

Other advice
● It is possible to comfortably achieve over 100 kills per hour occupying both the on task and off task room if you want to put in more effort. 
● Divines are generally not worth it because DKS tasks tend to take a while unless you have a resupply alt.
● You can use an alt to restock and heal yourself. When restocking, you can consider bringing the Divines based on the average time it takes to finish a task. (around 96 Dagannoths per hour).
● Healing yourself with the alt is done by the Heal other spell and healing your alt with Guthans on the upstairs Dagannoths after losing aggro. This is primarily done to compensate the lack of healing from Dagannoth Rex when using a Shadow.

This is the faster entry method. You should be comfortable with flicking multiple NPCs and offticking them either by aggroing them on different ticks, or stepping under or stepping back (in Rex's case) if they're attacking on the same tick. It's usually unlikely that Rex will even aggro you but I aggrod all 3 for demonstration purposes.

This is the slower entry method. If you're not comfortable flicking multiple NPCs, then just keep going up and down the ladder until Supreme is close to the ladder and the other 2 kings are at a distance. If you instantly go back up the ladder, you won't take damage from the DKS. Keep in mind that you can get unlucky and Prime can wander over and aggro you, so keep an eye on him and get ready to either flick or go back up the ladder and repeat the process if he does so.
