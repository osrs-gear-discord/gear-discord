# Advice/Info
- Replace the Max Cape with a Construction Cape or Teleport to House tabs. If you don't have a Fire of Eternal Light built, you will also need to take a light source of some kind (e.g. Kandarin headgear).
- You may optionally bring a Rune pouch to cast High Alchemy, but the alchable drops from this boss are very low value and don't drop very frequently, so for most players this isn't worth the effort.
- You may alternatively bring a Rune pouch to store the Death/Blood/Law runes drops from the boss, but these drop in very low quantities and infrequently, so most players will prefer an extra Super restore for a longer trip.
## Twisted Bow Method
- This is the better method for kills/hr.
- Use this safespot for the Twisted Bow method (the cannon spot and safespot are marked with blue tile markers)

## Dharok's Method
- Dragon claws → Unpoisoned Dragon dagger
- Ghrazi rapier → Zamorakian hasta
- Use the Bones to Peaches tabs to heal yourself just before your Divine boost expires, so that you can drink another dose.
- Always use your Special Attacks at the start of the kill, since attacks that create multiple hitsplats can cause the Giant Mole to dig multiple times. The Giant Mole can only dig when below 50% HP.
- Switch to your extra weapon (Ghrazi rapier/Zamorakian hasta) when the boss is relatively low HP as the extra accuracy becomes more important than having a higher max hit for avoiding extra digs.
- Use this spot for the Dharok's method (the cannon spot and character spot are marked with blue tile markers)
