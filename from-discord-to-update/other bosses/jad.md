# Advice/Info
## Speedrunning
- If you're not very skilled at the fight caves, using a setup similar to this may be beneficial (can add claws to spec when you don't need hp from blowpipe spec):
<IMG ~resources/jad/setup_4.png>
This setup should be more than good enough for the Fight Caves Speed-Runner combat achievement task.
- If you are using Runelite, install the "Fight Caves Spawn Predictor" plugin. It'll give an overlay of where the next wave's mobs will spawn. If not, look at the next bullet point.
- This tool is useful for predicting the spawns based on the first 2 waves. Use this to position yourself appropriately at the start of waves: <https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/TzHaar_Fight_Cave/Rotations>
- If you prefer to speedrun on a specific rotation, you can check when it will come up next using this spreadsheet (The time shown is the same as time shown in the Clan Chat tab ingame):

- Black chinchompas are for killing the small 1x1 NPCs (blobs and bats) in a single clump. It is possible to also lure these so they touch the South-West corner of a larger NPC then chin them to get extra damage on the big NPC, but this is a very niche situation and should only be done if you don't waste ticks while setting it up.
- The Craw's bow or Bow of faerdhinen is only used for first-hitting an NPC that is too far away for the blowpipe to reach (unless it is a mager). 
- Any 2 Guthix Rests can be replaced with a Saradomin brew and a Ranging potion. You can drink a brew dose and pot back up between hits with the Twisted bow.
- Spam death charge as much as possible.
- Respawn your thrall near the middle of the room (or where the next few mobs will spawn) any time it despawns or wanders off in the distance.
- If you are using vengeance: spam it as much as possible. You should be casting this every 30 seconds for the entire run. Heal up before Jad and double venge him by tickeating the 2nd attack.
### Inventory
- The Ranging potions are for re-potting and keeping your Divine timer running whenever you need to use Saradomin brews to heal.
- The Guthix rests are for healing without losing ticks or lowering your stats.
- It is assumed in the speedrun setups that you are pre-potting with a Divine at the bank, hence only taking a single potion into the cave. If you think your runs will take over 25 minutes, take a second Divine potion with you.
- If you have high prayer (90+), you use roughly 2 Super Restores every 5 minutes assuming you camp an overhead prayer + Rigour with zero downtime (varies slightly depending on your prayer bonus, but 2 per 5 is a safe estimate). Therefore 10 Super restores in the speedrun setups will last approximately 25 minutes. Adjust your personal potion ratios to suit your own speed.


## First Fire Cape
- It is **highly** recommended to get 75 Ranged and a Toxic Blowpipe with Amethyst Darts before going for your first Fire Cape. You sacrifice some defence by not using a crossbow + shield, but the damage boost from using a Blowpipe far outweighs this.
- Ancient Staff + runes for your best blood spell to heal on trapped NPCs. This will give you a lot of easy healing and allow you conserve the majority of your brews for later waves.
- Rune Crossbow for tagging healers during Jad as the Toxic Blowpipe has a very short range and might drag you into Jad's melee range if you're not used to it.
- Bastion Potion for Jad.

You can adjust the setup to suit your personal preferences. Here are a few possible adjustments:
- Taking tank legs (e.g. Verac's plateskirt) if you have a low defence level and find yourself taking too much damage during the waves or from Jad's healers.
- Taking a Slayer Helm (i)/Black Mask (i) to benefit from the on-task bonuses if you're willing to get a Jad task (must have Tzhaar slayer tasks unlocked).
- Taking some Dragon darts in your inventory to switch into your Toxic blowpipe during Wave 62 to use during the Jad fight.
- Taking less Super restores and more Saradomin brews (or vice versa) depending on whether you personally struggle more with HP or Prayer.
- Upgrading to a Necklace of anguish if you can afford it. This is a big boost to your DPS.
- Taking more Bastion potions for the waves to speed them up if you think you don't need so many supplies.
- Banking the Rune crossbow if you think you can tag Jad's healers safely with your Toxic blowpipe.
- Taking a Stamina potion if you find yourself struggling with run energy during the hectic waves.
