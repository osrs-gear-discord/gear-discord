Overhead Prayers
● If you do not have a protective shield (i.e. if you are using a Twisted Bow) you MUST use Protect from Magic otherwise KBD can hit up to 65 damage with his dragonfire. It is also beneficial to stand in melee distance as you take less damage overall by KBD attempting to melee you.
● If you have a protective shield (i.e. if you are using a DHCB or another crossbow), you should pray Protect from Melee and stand in melee distance, as you already have the maximum possible protection from KBD's dragonfire.
Suicide Method
● This method is very beneficial at KBD as it allows you to simultaneously suicide supplies and smuggle in max gear without risking the gear. Refer to this guide to perform the method: <https://i.imgur.com/iCjAfIe.png>
● Please note that valuable gear will cost 100k per piece to reclaim from your grave due to the death rework. If you don't wish to pay this price, you can follow the rest of the guide and just ignore the parts about taking taking 4 valuable items.
Twisted Bow vs DHCB vs DHL
● The Twisted Bow is the weapon of choice if you want the maximum kills/hr, however the DHCB is also extremely viable if you want a slightly more relaxed experience as you need to eat less often since you take less damage.
● DHL is the 3rd best option overall, it's still a good weapon but doesn't quite match the DHCB.
Shield Flicking
● If you're using a Twisted Bow, it is possible to take far less damage and therefore lengthen trips by stepping under KBD to maintain a 1:1 attack ratio while simultaneously flicking a shield when he attacks. 
● You would use Protect from Melee for this method as well as take far more Super Restores since you will require less food. 
● Start on the tile 2 squares north of the Uncut Sapphire spawn.
