## Setup 1
Arceuus - Blood / Cosmic / Fire / Soul / Death / Air

Rapier on Eclipse Moon, crush scythe on Blue Moon, slash scythe on Blood Moon. Use Crystal halberd spec when the boss is about to do a special, claw specs when you have >80 spec (preferably on Blue/Blood > Eclipse). 

Create potions as you need them, and catch lizards after you finish Eclipse Moon and are running to Blue Moon.

Purple potions are moonlight potions that you create inside the dungeon. They provide the effects of a regular supercombat and prayer potion at the same time.

Soulreaper axe is for Eclipse Moon's teleport special. Downgrades are Elder maul, godswords, or Crystal halberd. 

Lightbearer can be equipped when running between rooms, and optionally during specials when the boss is invulnerable. This is very minor.
