Advice/Info 

Gear Advice
● Main weapons: ● Main weapons: Full inq scythe > Full inq mace > Max str mace > Full inq bludgeon > Max strength scythe > Max strength bludgeon > Sarachnis Cudgel > Zamorakian Hasta (If you're using any other setup or combination of items, calculate the best for you using dps calculator in ⁠spreadsheets)
● Magic weapons: Harmonized Staff w/ Tome of Fire and Fire Surge > Sanguinesti Staff (w/ imbued heart) > Toxic Trident (w/ imbued heart)
● Replace any inquisitor's piece you don't own with Torva > Bandos. This will likely make you the tank should the rest of your team be in full inquisitor.
● If you don't own an infernal cape, bring the mythical cape instead of a fire cape.
● One DWHer should equip their guardian boots if they want to tank. Switch back to prims and have the backup DWHer switch to guardians if low hp and you don't want to have a chance at getting meleed.
● Volatile role will claw spec beginning of phase 1 to start regenning spec, then spec the totems whenever they have spec ready. 
● D2H role specs husks during phase 1. Everyone should be on the same tile except possibly the tank. If possible have the tank run over to the same tile as everyone else when they see the nightmare using the husk special. This is to ensure the D2H hits every husk, should the tank also have husks spawn.
● Ham Joint is used for sleepwalkers and husks that survive the D2H spec. 
Fight Advice
● DWHers should communicate if they hit their specs to ensure that one spec is hit per phase. More than one spec is unneccessary as her defence doesn't go lower than 120.
● If you bring an SGS, you should use it on the sleepwalkers for max heals.
● Preferably only eat between phases after having killed the sleepwalkers
● Everyone should claw spec their own parasites, and coordinate who should spec the DWH roles' parasites if they do not have 100% spec.
● If you don't have a tank you should camp melee pray and switch to mage/range when you see/hear the attacks. The melee attack has a much shorter warning and maxes 60s on the wrong prayer.
● If you do have a tank, you should stand behind the boss to avoid the melee attacks. You won't have to pray melee if you're behind her.
● Having dedicated totem roles can speed up the totem phases by a lot.
● If you get drowzy during the final phase, stay at least 2 tiles away from every member of the team to avoid it spreading.

Finding Teams
Finding split teams can be difficult ever since the introduction of ⁠phosanis-nightmare, however if you want free-for-all teams, you can join the "NM Only" cc or discord (https://discord.gg/3NEfQJz) or the "nm ffa" cc or discord (https://discord.gg/RfdFYt3).
If you still need a split team I'd recommend joining a clan.

Most of these teams do not require an alt and are not coordinated enough to do roles listed above (unless specified by team), so if you plan on doing NM here you should use a setup somewhat similar to the "no alt-setup" shown at the bottom of the channel. 

Solo
After the introduction of ⁠phosanis-nightmare there is no reason to do regular solo nightmare unless you're very new to the boss and need practice before moving on to Phosani. Phosanis Nightmare has fewer hours for pet completion, more uniques per hour and better regular loot.

Fight Advice
Make sure you Brew -> SCB between hits to ensure every hit is on max stats.
A Blood Fury may prove useful to almost entirely negate the need for food without sacrificing much DPS. You should still bring a Torture for when you are full or near full hp.
Phase 1: Double claw spec when fight starts. Kill husks using the inquisitor's mace.
Phase 2: Run under the boss just before the parasite spawns to lower the chance of it successfully healing the boss. If it manages to walk out, either step behind the parasite (so it is between you and the boss), or stay under the boss opposite the parasite so the boss paths over it. Claw spec parasites whenever you have spec, use inquisitor's mace whenever you don't.
Phase 3: Stay away from mushrooms. Make sure you kite the boss if your hitpoints is below 16 as you cannot redemption the melee attack.

If you don't have an alt
If you do not have an alt account (and for whatever reason do not want to create one) you'll want to lengthen the trip as much as possible, as banking is a huge waste of time. Finding a team will be much harder without an alt.
This setup should be around 8-12 kills per trip provided the team is somewhat good at nightmare and has decent gear. https://i.imgur.com/oRNZtJ3.png
