# Advice/Info 
## Gear Advice
- Main weapons: Full inq scythe > Full inq w/ mace > Max str mace > Full inq bludgeon > Max strength scythe > Max strength bludgeon (If you're using any other setup or combination of items, calculate the best for you using dps calculator in ⁠spreadsheets)
- Magic weapons: Harmonized Staff w/ Tome of Fire and Fire Surge > Sanguinesti Staff (w/ imbued heart) > Toxic Trident (w/ imbued heart)
- If you're not bringing a Harmonised staff, you should bring Thralls and Death Charge on the Arceuus spellbook. Kills are only slightly longer.
- Replace any Inquisitor's piece you don't own with max strength (Bandos + faceguard).
- If you don't own an infernal cape, bring the mythical cape instead of a fire cape.
- Doing multiple kill trips may be beneficial if you don't have an alt to resupply you, especially if you do not have the teleport unlocked. One SCB and 3 sanfews should be enough for two kills, how many food and switches you want to bring is up to you and your flicking abilities.
Extra items:
- Ham Joint is used for husks. Can be exchanged for an Event rpg (free from Diango). Simply unequipping your scythe to punch them will only be 1 tick slower per husk.
- Elder Maul is used for parasites. Can be exchanged for any godsword on crush.
 - In the no alt setup, bring a saradomin godsword; if you're low hp and don't want to eat, you can SGS spec one of the sleepwalkers for a free +34 heal.
- Blowpipe or Craw's bow is used for sleepwalkers. 
 - If using the Craw's bow, you will have to melee the last sleepwalker on the 4th phase because of the longer projectile travel time.
- Voidwaker > Granite Maul (w/ maul handle) > Dragon Claws is for special attacks on the boss. 
 - Voidwaker is the best option by far. If you don't have this: granite maul is slightly better than claws if you have full inquisitor's, but more difficult to use.
## Fight advice
- Double spec when the kills starts. If you're using the gmaul do scythe -> double gmaul -> scythe. With claws just use both specs before scything.
- The first four phases are the exact same, however if the boss uses husks on one phase any other "spawn" special will also be husks. Same for parasites.
- When hitting husks using ham joint or parasites using elder maul, make sure your max hit is over 20 and over 55. If your max hit is under you will not one hit them. Equipping Ham Joint/Elder Maul + torture and praying piety should give you a high enough max hit.
- Unless going for multi kill trips or running out of supplies, tanking a black hole is better than getting drowzy from moving into a mushroom.
- If you're using a scythe, the black hole special can be easily countered by stepping under the corner tile of the boss just before the black holes deal damage. If doing this during the mushroom phase, remember that your character will prioritize moving east or west over moving north or south when moving out from underneath the boss. https://i.imgur.com/EWirSdO.gif
