# Advice/Info
- The setup assumes that you have a mounted Xeric's Talisman in your PoH. If you don't have this, replace 1 food with a Xeric's talisman.
- If you're soloing without an Amulet of blood fury, use 1 Divine supercombat potion and 5 Super restores.
## Gear downgrades
- Scythe of vitur (on slash) → Inquisitor's mace → Abyssal bludgeon → Blade of saeldor → Zamorakian hasta (on crush) → Sarachnis cudgel
- Dragon claws → Dragon dagger
- If you're using a non-Scythe weapon, it is optimal to bring an Elder Maul to use for your 4th attack after each web phase.
- It is optimal to use your special attacks when Sarachnis is below 33% hp (i.e. after the 2nd minion spawn), as this is when you take the most damage.
## Main Advice
- Protect from Melee + Piety.
- Switch to Protect from Missiles whenever Sarachnis uses her web attack, as she will always attack with ranged after this.
- Ensure you are standing between these 4 tile markers (i.e. anywhere in the green zone) when Sarachnis uses her web attack. This will ensure that she only ranges you once instead of twice after each web attack.
