Advice/Info
● The setup assumes that you have a mounted Xeric's Talisman in your PoH. If you don't have this, replace 1 food with a Xeric's Talisman.
● If you're soloing without an Amulet of Blood Fury, use 1 Divine SCB and 5 Super Restores.
Weapons
● Scythe of Vitur (on slash) → Inquisitor's Mace → Abyssal Bludgeon → Blade of Saeldor → Zamorakian Hasta (on crush) → Sarachnis Cudgel.
● Dragon Claws → DDS.
● If you're using a non-Scythe weapon, it is optimal to bring an Elder Maul to use for your 4th attack after each web phase.
● It is optimal to use your special attacks when Sarachnis is below 33% (i.e. after the 2nd minion spawn) as this is when you take the most damage.
Main Advice
● Protect from Melee + Piety.
● Switch to Protect from Missiles whenever Sarachnis uses her web attack as she will always attack with ranged after this.
● Ensure you are standing between these 4 tile markers (i.e. anywhere in the green zone) when Sarachnis uses her web attack. This will ensure that she only ranges you once instead of twice after each web attack. https://i.imgur.com/GxYIi2m.png
Alt Advice
● Protect from Magic + Piety.
● Use the alt to cast Potion Share and Energy Transfer.
● At the end of your trip you can cast Tele Group Moonclan to teleport both of your accounts to a nearby bank in an easy way.
