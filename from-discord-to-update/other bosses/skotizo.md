# Advice/Info
While the Scythe of Vitur appears to be better than a Twisted Bow at face value on a DPS calculator, there are several reasons the Twisted Bow is considered better for Skotizo:
- You take almost 0 damage therefore you lose no time due to eating food
- You can continue attacking the boss while running around the room towards the altars, and after killing an altar you can instantly hit Skotizo again from a distance
- You can take more totems per trip and waste less time banking since you will usually use no food (if not doing the clues from the boss)

If you don't have a Twisted bow or a Scythe, ignore the range switch and just use an Arclight against the boss. Take other obvious switches such as an Infernal/Fire Cape and a Berserker Ring (i).

- If you don't have Inquisitor's armour, just use whatever maximum crush bonus you have (Dwarven helmet, Tyrannical ring(i), Mythical cape etc.)

- If you have high combat stats (90+), you can ignore the altars until all 4 are active then just disable 2 and continue attacking Skotizo. Disabling all 4 altars is slower than just disabling 2 and hitting the boss again.

- Pray melee when in melee range, pray mage otherwise.
