Advice/Info
While the Scythe of Vitur appears to be better than a Twisted Bow at face value on a DPS calculator, there are several reasons the Twisted Bow is considered better for Skotizo:
● With a Twisted Bow you take almost 0 damage therefore you lose no time due to eating food
● With a Twisted Bow you can continue DPSing Skotizo while running around the room towards the altars, and after killing an altar you can instantly hit Skotizo again from a distance
● With a Twisted Bow you can take more totems per trip and waste less time banking since you will usually use no food

● If you don't have a Twisted Bow or a Scythe, ignore the range switch and just use an Arclight against Skotizo. Take other obvious switches such as an Infernal/Fire Cape and a Berserker Ring (i).

● If you don't have Inquisitor just use whatever maximum crush bonus you have. (Dwarven helmet, tyrannical ring(i), mythical cape etc)

● If you have high combat stats (90+), you can ignore the altars until all 4 are active then just disable 2 and continue killing Skotizo. Disabling all 4 altars is slower than just disabling 2 and killing Skotizo.

● Pray melee when in melee range, pray mage when outside of melee range.
