Advice/Info
Both setups are very similar kills/hr (both around 33/hr at max effort), but the DHL method is slightly better profit when you consider the cost of bolts. The DHL setup is also better if you don't own a Dragonfire ward. 
Dragon hunter crossbow setup
● Pray range. 
● Use Void if you don't have Masori, Zaryte vambraces or Lightbearer (difference is very minimal).
● Replace Zaryte crossbow with Toxic blowpipe if you don't have the former or uncomfortable with DHCB woox walk.
● You must use Extended super antifire potions. If it's not Super, it will not provide max dragonfire protection.
● If you do not own a Dragonfire ward, use a regular Anti-dragon shield instead. Any other shields should NOT be used. DFS is not an ideal option as it has a negative range bonus.
● Taking a couple of Guthix rests is optional. They can be used to tick-eat the blue mage attacks when you're at less than 30hp and don't want to waste 3 ticks by eating a regular food.
● The special attack weapons worth using with the DHCB setup is the Toxic blowpipe and Zaryte crossbow and these should be used exclusively for the special attack. If you aren't comfortable with DHCB woox walking, you may use the blowpipe to woox walk.
● Switch to diamond bolts at ~31% hp or 234hp with Masori and around 35% hp or 260hp with Void.
● You should NOT change the gear if you're on-task.
Dragon hunter lance setup
● Pray mage. 
● You must use Extended super antifire potions. If it's not Super, it will not provide max dragonfire protection.
● You can autocast Crumble undead by taking a Slayer staff/SOTD/SOL switch.
● Melee spec weapons: Voidwaker >> Dragon claws > Bandos godsword.
● As long as you have a Neitiznot faceguard, you should not be using a Slayer helm (i) + Amulet of torture for Vorkath, regardless of your cape. If you don't have a Neitiznot faceguard, then Slayer helm (i) + Amulet of torture is worth using only with a Fire cape.
If you cannot afford a DHCB or a DHL
● Pray mage.
● Teleport to your POH after every kill to recharge your special attack. https://i.imgur.com/6aWiYEc.png
