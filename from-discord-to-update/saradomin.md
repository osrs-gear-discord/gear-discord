Advice/Info
Solo
● The Shadow setup is better DPS however you lack a meaningful way to boost your defence level and your equipment defence bonuses are low which will cause you take significantly increased minion damage if you're not flicking, leading to situations where you'll be forced to waste ticks eating during kills and potentially panic brewing to drain your Magic level. Therefore any DPS advantage will be lost.
● For the ranged method, equip the BP + Serp at the start to venom the minions (100% chance of inflicting venom when you deal damage) then switch back to the Twisted Bow + Masori Helmet for killing the boss. 
● If you're flicking the minions while ranging, do not use the venom tactic. Also adjust your supplies to have more stat boosting potions and less brews. You can use divines in this case since you'll be brewing far less often.
● Take note of the specific items used, you will always want a Saradomin and Zamorak item to protect from the monsters outside the boss room.
● If you want to put in a bit more effort and avoid using sweets/stams, you can use GeChallengeM's method (shown below). This is not compatible with flicking the minions.

Dolo
● The alt should kill Bree > Starlight > Growler. You could also take a 2nd Twisted Bow on this account and help DPS Zilyana after killing Bree + Starlight if you wanted. This can be stretched further by incorporating world-hopping too.
● If you're using a Shadow on the main, it's still worth pot sharing the Bastion potions just for the defence boost.
● The blood runes are just for an emergency situation, you can cast Heal Other on your main account for a quick injection of HP.
