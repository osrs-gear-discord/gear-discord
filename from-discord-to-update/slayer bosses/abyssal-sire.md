# Advice/Info
## Gear Advice
- Arclight should be set to slash for the entire kill.
- You can bring crystal body + legs with the Bow of faerdhinen for the vent phase but you will need to fit divine ranging potions in your inventory; therefore this should only be done if you have an alt.

## Vents
- Use Sanguinesti staff on long-range against the vents. 
- Here are some useful tiles to mark for "vent phase" if you are using the sanguinesti staff:

- If doing the solo method, try to preserve your run energy as much as possible, and use blood barrage the final few hits if your hp isn't close to full towards the end of the last vent(s).
- Use blood barrage as a first hit when running over to the next vent as this has a longer range than the sanguinesti staff on long range. This is not necessary if you're already full hp.
- If you are using Bow of Faerdhinen follow this path to not lose ticks during the "vent phase":

You need to react to hits, if you think you've killed the vent you move on to the next one, you can go back if you didn't actually kill it (unlike what I did on the third vent of the vid)
- The Bow of Faerdhinen, while only slightly better DPS than Sanguinesti staff, should be a lot more consistent in doing one down vents if you are doing this method correctly. 

## Solo
- If you don't have Sanguinesti staff and don't want to blood barrage to full hp on the respiratory system, it is better to PoH between every kill (unless you're full hp from taking no damage from boss). Switch the Sanguinesti staff for a Toxic trident.
- If you do have Sanguinesti staff, heal to full on the last few respiratory systems using blood barrages if you're not already full hp. Else just continue DPSing with Sang staff.
- If you have 100% spec you should use a spec ASAP, and the second spec some time during P3 or 4 to stop yourself from taking too much damage.
- You should never have to blood barrage the minions unless you're very unlucky.
- Preserve your run energy as much as possible so you never end up walking to the last vent(s).

## 1+1
- It's better to heal other before spec transfer since spec transfer is 10hp no matter what your current HP is, but heal other takes a % off of your current HP.
- The scythe should only be used for the final phase (sub140 hp).
- If you're not slow, your alt should be healing you twice per kill resulting in 4 special attacks.
- If you for whatever reason don't want to bring Arclight, bring Dragon warhammer and spec until you land a successful special attack, then use Dragon claws for all subsequent special attacks.

## 1+2
- To do 1+2 you need an alternate account with an Abyssal Demons or Abyssal Sire slayer task.
- The vent killer alt will wake the boss and kill the vents on another world while the main account kills sire.
- Once the vent killer has killed all 4 vents, it'll hop back to the world the main is on to kill a new set of vents. The main account and the spec xfer/heal alt should then hop to the world where the vent killer just woke the Sire. It will take a few seconds before the Sire switches aggro.
- Using the Bow of faerdhinen, the alt will take some damage from the divine potions (+ the damage from tentacles), so you may need to heal the vent alt from the spec xfer / heal alt every so often.
- You can switch the bowfa out for a Sanguinesti staff in max mage to negate the need for healing. Bring a saturated heart, 4 staminas and fill the rest of the inventory with restores in this case.
