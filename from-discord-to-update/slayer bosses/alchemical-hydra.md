Advice/Info
- If you don't have the elite tier of the Kourend & Kebos diary completed, you need some form of protective footwear. Boots of Brimstone are the best option for this.
- Cape slot: Ava's Assembler -> Max Cape → Ranging Cape (t). 
- If you don't have zaryte vambraces; With Divine Potions, you won't lose any max hits by losing the Ava's Assembler and thus the prayer bonus from the Max Cape/Ranging Cape outweighs the minimal accuracy increase of the Assembler.
- Since the Hydra's defence is so low, it is generally better to optimise your prayer bonus in order to stay for longer trips rather than maximising your range bonus. This can be seen in the Max Cape/Ranging Cape (t), Devout Boots, Ring of the Gods (i) and Crystal Armour. If you don't have any of these, simply use the next best alternative (Ring of Suffering (i), Armadyl Armour, etc.).
- You may choose to bring thrall runes instead of alchs for your first trip of the day and bring an Explorer's Ring 4 to alch whatever alchables the boss drops. I wouldn't recommend bringing thralls without an explorer's ring, the alchables make up a fair bit of profit.

Mechanics
- In order to do full damage to the Hydra you will need to lure it onto the vents:
Green Hydra → Red Vent
Blue Hydra → Green Vent
Red Hydra → Blue Vent
An easy way of identifying that you have done it correctly is by looking above the Hydra's head. He will say Roaaaaaaaaaaar! when his defences are lowered.
- The Hydra will start each kill with a random attack style and switch every 3 attacks (NOT including special attacks such as Acid, Lightning and Flame Trail).
- The final phase of Hydra (the black form) will attack you in an alternating pattern, it will start with the **OPPOSITE** of what the last attack it threw at you was. For example if it throws a range attack before the phase change, the first attack will be a mage attack.
Inventory
- If you are not confident with being able to do long trips, take 2 Divine Ranging Potions, 8 Super Restores, 1 Antidote++ and 12 food.
- The Crystal Dust is so you can make extra Divine potions from the potions that the boss drops.
- Equip the Bonecrusher necklace during the hydra's death animation if you want to get back a few prayer points, else just let it sit in the inventory to autobury bones.

Weapon downgrade & DHCB vs Toxic Blowpipe
- If you don't have a Twisted Bow, then you should take both of these weapons. Use the Dragon Hunter Crossbow with Ruby Dragon Bolts (e) and a Twisted Buckler until the Hydra is at 22%, or ~240 HP then switch to your Toxic Blowpipe for the rest of the kill. 22% is the perfect value for Amethyst Darts, if you're using Dragon Darts then switch at 38.1%(420) HP. Don't take Diamond Dragon Bolts (e).
- If you don't own a range strength boosting shield, bring a Book of Law instead.
- When using these weapons, you should be using the Ava's Assembler only if you're using dragon darts.
- You can expect around 23-25 kills/hr using the blowpipe and/or DHCB.
