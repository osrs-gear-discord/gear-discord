# Advice/Info
- The runes are for Greater ghostly thralls and Death Charge (fire runes outside rune pouch) - cast these whenever you can. If you do not own a Divine rune pouch, replace a super restore with the missing rune type.
- Try to keep your prayer between 30-45 when ghosts spawn as they drain 15 prayer each: if you have under 45 prayer you are getting drained for less. For example, if you start with 35 prayer:
First drain → 35-15 = 20
Second drain → 20-15 = 5
Third drain → 5-15 = 0
As you can see, the 3rd drain can only drain you for 5 points rather than 15, effectively saving you 10 prayer points.
- Overheal with a dose of Saradomin Brew before each Divine potion dose.

## Melee advice
- Melee is superior kills/hr.
- The Amulet of blood fury makes the written suicide method below unnecessary. However the suicide method can still be used to save money from the Blood shard cost. You can also bring an Amulet of torture switch to use whenever you're above 80 hp.
- For melee spec weapons: Dragon claws → BGS → DDS 
[NOTE: Only use BGS if you are using scythe **without** Inquisitor's armour]
- For regular melee weapons: Scythe of Vitur (on crush) → Inquisitor's mace with inq → Arclight (on stab) → Inquisitor's mace without inqr → Ghrazi Rapier → Abyssal Bludgeon → Sarachnis Cudgel → Zamorakian Hasta (on crush) 
[Cudgel and Hasta should be switched if you have an Avernic defender - the previous list assumes a Dragon defender]
  
## Ranged advice
- Zaryte crossbow is mainly for the special attack and hitting it during ghosts. Use the special at the start of the kill and utilise Death charge as much as possible. If you do not own this, use Dragon knives and Toxic blowpipe as your one handed and spec weapon respectively.
- For the cape slot: Max cape or Ranging cape (t) are better than Ava's assembler if you do not have Zaryte vambraces. 
- Make sure you bring a Construction Cape or house tabs if you don't have a Max Cape
- Make sure you have the Assembler effect on the Max / Ranging cape by using a Vorkath's head on it
- Blowpipe is only for the special attacks
  
## Looting Bag/Suicide Method
### Part 1: Obtaining Bags
Purchase a Looting Bag Note from the GE and use it on a bank to convert it into a Looting Bag.
  
### Part 2: The Actual Method
The idea behind this method is that you can fill your looting bag and inventory with supplies, suicide them at the boss, then do a real trip with another inventory of supplies. This allows you to triple your trip length. Another big benefit of this method is that you will profit key master teleport drops on average. Unless you get unlucky you should always be getting scrolls at a faster rate than you use them due to the length of these trips. 

Here is an example of what to take when you suicide (**SKULL ON THE EMBLEM TRADER BEFORE YOU SUICIDE**):

Reminder that you must go to Ferox Enclave or level 1 Wilderness to fill the looting bag
