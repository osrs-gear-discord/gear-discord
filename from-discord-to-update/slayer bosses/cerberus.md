Advice/Info
● The runes are for the Greater ghostly thrall and Death charge. Cast these whenever you can. Replace one super restore with one of the four runes that would have been in the Divine rune pouch if you do not own one.
● Try to keep your prayer between 30-45 when ghosts spawn as they drain 15 prayer each, therefore if you have under 45 prayer you are getting drained for less. For example, if you start with 35 prayer:
First drain → 35-15 = 20
Second drain → 20-15 = 5
Third drain → 5-15 = 0
As you can see, the 3rd drain can only drain you for 5 points rather than 15, effectively saving you 10 prayer points.
● Melee is superior kills/hr.
● Zaryte crossbow is mainly for the special attack and hitting it during ghosts. Use the special at the start of the kill and utilise Death charge as much as possible. If you do not own this, use Dragon knives and Toxic blowpipe as your one handed and spec weapon respectively.
● Overheal with a dose of Saradomin Brew before each Divine Bastion Potion or Divine Super Combat Potion dose.

Melee advice
● The Amulet of blood fury makes the written suicide method below unnecessary. However the suicide can still be used to save money from the Blood shard cost. You can also bring a Amulet of torture switch and use it whenever you're above 80 hp.
● For melee spec weapons: Dragon Claws → BGS → DDS 
[NOTE: If you're not using a Scythe then do not use BGS]
[NOTE 2: If you don't have Inquisitor's, but still using a Scythe, then use a BGS]
● For regular melee weapons: Scythe of Vitur (on crush) → Inquisitor's mace → Arclight (on stab) → Ghrazi Rapier → Abyssal Bludgeon → Sarachnis Cudgel → Zamorakian Hasta (on crush) 
[Cudgel and Hasta should be switched if you have an Avernic Defender - the previous list assumes a Dragon Defender]
[Also Inquisitor's mace and Arclight should be switched if you don't have Inquisitor's hauberk and plateskirt].
  
Ranged advice
● For the cape slot: Ava's assembler (if you have Zaryte vambraces) -> Max cape (if you don't have Zaryte vambraces, this is for defensive and prayer bonuses, perks such as holy wrench, little bit of healing and teleports - Assembler doesn't give you a max hit without the vambraces so these outweighs the accuracy bonus of the Assembler) → Ranging cape (t) → Ava's assembler (without Zaryte vambraces)
● Make sure you bring a Construction Cape or house tabs if you don't have a Max Cape
● Make sure you have the Assembler effect on the cape you bring by using a Vorkath's head on it
● Blowpipe is only for the special attacks
  
Looting Bag/Suicide Method Part 1: Obtaining Bags
Purchase a Looting Bag Note from the GE and use it on a bank to convert it into a Looting Bag.
  
Looting Bag/Suicide Method Part 2: The Actual Method
The idea behind this method is that you can fill your looting bag and inventory with supplies, suicide them at the boss, then do a real trip with another inventory of supplies. This allows you to triple your trip length. Another big benefit of this method is that you will profit key master teleport drops on average. Unless you get unlucky you should always be getting scrolls at a faster rate than you use them due to the length of these trips. 

Here is an example of what to take when you suicide (reminder that you must go to level 1 wilderness to fill the looting bag - also a reminder to SKULL ON THE EMBLEM TRADER BEFORE YOU SUICIDE): https://i.imgur.com/iZpIql1.png
