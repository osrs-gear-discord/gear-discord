# Advice/Info
- Ideally you should be using Dragon darts in order to maximise your chance to entirely skip Dawn's healing orb phase and kill her before the orbs are able to heal her.
- The Blood fury will remove almost any need for food. The food in both setups is meant as an emergency heal incase you're at low enough hp for the boss to have a chance to KO you. After the boss drops a few mushrooms you should be fine for the remainder of the trip.
- For both setups, bringing an Amulet of Torture may prove beneficial in that you don't waste charges on the Blood Fury by using it when you're already full hp.

## Special attack weapon
- Overall, the two options result in very similar kills/hr. The SGS provides slower kills but longer trips (around 60-90 minutes depending on RNG) whereas a DPS weapon (Dragon Claws or DDS) will result in faster kills but shorter trips (around 30-60 minutes depending on RNG).
- SGS - You can get away with the recommended amount of food if you are good at avoiding all the avoidable damage - lightning, knockback, falling rocks, flame prison etc. If you are new with the boss bring a 1-2 extra anglers or a brew. Use your special attack as the final hit on phase 2 or phase 4 in order to minimise the DPS loss from using it.
- Dragon Claws/DDS - Similarly to before, you can get away with the recommended amount of food if you are good at avoiding damage. Bring an extra brew or an extra brew + angler if you are new with the boss or bad at avoiding damage. Use your special attacks on the 4th phase of the fight to speed it up as that is when the majority of damage is taken.
## Weapon Downgrades
- Scythe of vitur → Ghrazi rapier/Blade of saeldor/Inquisitor's mace → Abyssal tentacle

## Fight Advice
- Manually smashing the guardians at the end of P3 and P4 can save some ticks. In some cases, manually smashing at the end of P3 can be the difference between succeeding or failing a heal skip. Similarly, manually smashing at the end of P4 can be the difference between tanking an extra hit from Dusk.
- If you don't want to prayer flick both guardians during P1, you can camp Protect from Melee and wear your Torva armour.
- During P3, ensure that you stand in melee distance of Dawn for 2 reasons: she is able to melee you if you're in melee distance which reduces damage taken since you're using Protect from Melee, and it will increase your chance of skipping the healing orbs since you won't have to run up to her to smash her.
- During P3 you may pick up the orbs closest to the boss if you can do so without losing ticks, this should make the heal skip slightly more consistent. There's only a small chance of failing if using thralls and dragon darts, but this may still help the 1 in 30 times where the skip fails due bad rng.
- During the P4 flame prison attack, don't spamclick to escape the prison. Spam clicking can path you the wrong way if the prison is placed against a wall and force you to take the damage. If it is placed against a wall, you can stand on the empty tile to take no damage:
