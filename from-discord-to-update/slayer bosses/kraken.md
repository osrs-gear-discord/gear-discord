Advice/Info
● When starting the kill with fishing explosives, you will want to throw the fishing explosives while close to the boss, run back 5-6 tiles and run back towards the boss once the projectile is in the air. With a Shadow of tumeken, you can walk 3 tiles instead. This will save you 2 ticks per kill, and allows you to get another ~2 kills per hour if done correctly.

If you are using a Sanguinesti staff, it needs to be put on long range.
- Pray Preserve and bring a Super restore if you don't have a Saturated heart.
- The Volatile Nightmare Staff can be used as a spec weapon.
- If you don't have a Magus ring, use a Ring of suffering instead.
- Use Ancestral if:
→ You have a Harm - or Sanguinesti Staff (shield doesn't matter)
→ OR you have a Toxic Trident with an Elysian Spirit Shield (no other shield can substitute this)
- If you don't have a Harmonised Nightmare Staff, Sanguinesti Staff OR an Elysian Spirit Shield then you should prioritise mage defence.
→ Masori > Armadyl > Karil's 
→ Spectral Spirit Shield > Dragonfire Ward > Twisted Buckler > Mage's Book
