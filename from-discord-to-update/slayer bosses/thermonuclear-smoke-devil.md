# Advice/Info
- **DO NOT TELEPORT TO POH BETWEEN KILLS**
- **ENSURE YOUR RECOIL EFFECT IS ENABLED IF WEARING SUFFERING**
- Setup 1 is optimal for kills/hr. However, if you don't have a Scythe, you can use Setup 2 even if you don't have a Shadow - just use your best mage weapon and offhand.
- Melee weapon: Scythe of vitur → Blade of saeldor/Ghrazi rapier → Abyssal tentacle (Take a Ring of suffering (ri) instead of a Berserker ring (i) if you don't use the scythe)
- Mage weapon: Tumeken's shadow → Harmonised nightmare staff (with Tome of Fire, on Standard spellbook) → Sanguinesti staff → Trident of the swamp.
- Special attack weapon: Claws → DDS

## Solo Advice (no alt)
- Setup 1 and Setup 2 is about the same amount of kills/hr.
- If using Setup 1, stepping under Thermy between Scythe hits can prevent a lot of damage. This will, in turn, cause you to trigger Redemption less often therefore prolonging your trips. However if you're using an Abyssal Tentacle, you should simply stand still and tank Thermy's hits to maximise your DPS from your recoil effect.
- Using the entrance crevice or any other red-click (such as a cannon base or dropped item) to walk under will stop the boss from moving while you are underneath it.
  - If you sip a potion while underneath the boss you must click to attack it again in the same tick or it will be able to move again
- If using Setup 2, only drink your Super Combat whenever your Special Attack is at 100%, so you can use 2 specs at 118 stats.

## Dolo Advice (using an alt)
- It's better to heal other before spec transfer, since spec transfer heals 10hp no matter what your current HP is, but heal other takes a % off of your current HP.
- Don't bother bringing magic defence bottoms
