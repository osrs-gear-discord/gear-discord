Advice/Info
● DO NOT TELEPORT TO YOUR POH BETWEEN KILLS.
● ENSURE YOUR RECOIL EFFECT IS ENABLED IF YOU ARE MAGING/WHIPPING WITH A SUFFERING.
● For melee spec weapons: Claws > DDS.
● For regular melee weapons: Scythe of Vitur > Blade of Saeldor > Abyssal Tentacle (Take a Ring of Suffering (ri) instead of a Berserker Ring (i) if you don't use the scythe)
● For regular mage weapons: Harmonised Staff > Sanguinesti Staff > Trident of the Swamp.

If you're soloing (no alt)
● Setup 1 and Setup 2 is about the same amount of kills/hr.
● If you're using Setup 1, stepping under Thermy between Scythe hits can prevent a lot of damage. This will, in turn, cause you to trigger Redemption less often therefore prolonging your trips. However if you're using an Abyssal Tentacle, you should simply stand still and tank Thermy's hits to maximise your DPS from your recoil effect.
● Using the entrance crevice or any other red-click (such as a dropped item) to walk under will stop the boss from moving when you are underneath (If you are doing this, drinking a restore while underneath will make it path away again).
● If you're using Setup 2, only drink your Super Combat whenever your Special Attack is at 100%, so you can use 2 specs at 118 stats.

If you're doloing (using an alt)
● It's better to heal other before spec transfer, since spec transfer heals 10hp no matter what your current HP is, but heal other takes a % off of your current HP.
● Don't bother bringing a karil's skirt or void bottoms.
● Setup 1 is optimal for kills/hr. However, if you don't have a Scythe, you can use Setup 2, even if you don't have a harmonised staff.
