# Advice/Info
- Optionally, you may bring a Ring of Wealth (i) switch for a doubled chance at elite clues.
- If you want a bit of extra DPS, bringing thralls adds 0.625 dps to your damage. 
- If you don't have Webweaver or Craw's bow: Twisted bow is the 2nd best option, followed by Toxic blowpipe.
- Hop worlds between kills as the respawn timer of the Chaos Elemental is very long.
- If you are paying attention, it is worth keeping 1 open inventory slot to allow the boss to use its disarming attack. This attack does no damage, causing you to use less food per kill, and it is easy to re-equip 1 item whenever it uses the ability.
- If you're interested in saving some money, you can compare the prices of regular supplies to their Blighted counterparts (<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blighted>) and use whichever is cheaper.
