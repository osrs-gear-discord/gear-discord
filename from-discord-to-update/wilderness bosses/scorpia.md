Advice/Info 
● Blighted Ancient Ice Sacks save 2 inventory spaces and are cheaper than the regular runes to cast Ice Barrage.
● As a duo, you can completely ignore Scorpia's healers and DPS through them making this a very easy method. Upwards of 100 kills/hr.
● Use Mystic Might instead of Augury. Magic accuracy gives you very little benefit here and Augury drains your prayer significantly faster (Augury is obviously superior if you flick it).
● If doloing, it's recommended to take pretty much the same setup except downgrade the gear slightly to decrease your snipe chance. Even with downgraded gear you should still keep an eye on your xp drops/hitsplats as it's very easy to snipe kills here.
If you're interested in saving some money, you can compare the prices of regular supplies to their Blighted counterparts (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blighted) and use whichever is cheaper.

Sanguinesti Staff vs Thammaron's Sceptre vs Harmonised Staff
Technically, Harmonised Nightmare Staff/Thammaron's Sceptre with Fire Surge are both better DPS than a Sanguinesti Staff. However you must be on the normal spellbook to cast Fire Surge, therefore you need an alt to freeze Scorpia. Using Fire Surge also comes with the downside of risking a significant value in runes as you must take a high number of casts with you to last a decent amount of time. The Harmonised Nightmare Staff is better than the Sceptre.
