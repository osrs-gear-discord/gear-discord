# Advice/Info 
- Blighted Ancient Ice Sacks save 2 inventory spaces and are cheaper than the regular runes to cast Ice Barrage.
- As a duo, you can completely ignore Scorpia's healers and DPS through them making this a very easy method, upwards of 100 kills/hr. The person who received kill credit last kill is the next one to freeze the boss: this is to balance kills across both players and make it easy to know whose turn it is.
- Use Mystic Lore or Might instead of Augury. Magic accuracy gives very little benefit here and Augury drains your prayer significantly faster (Augury is obviously superior if you flick it).
- If doloing, it's recommended to take pretty much the same setup except downgrade the gear slightly to decrease your snipe chance. Even with downgraded gear you should still keep an eye on your xp drops/hitsplats as it's very easy to snipe kills here.
If you're interested in saving some money, you can compare the prices of regular supplies to their Blighted counterparts (<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blighted>) and use whichever is cheaper.
