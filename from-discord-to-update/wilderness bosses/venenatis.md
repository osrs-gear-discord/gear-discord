Advice/Info
● This setup is fairly high risk. Each death costs:
- 6m for parchments (torso, defender, cape, rune pouch)
- 300k (barrows gloves, nezzy, dragon boots)
Change the setup to your preference if you want to avoid losing so much per death e.g. 
- fighter torso (l) > proselyte top
- infernal cape (l) > mythical cape
- avernic defender (l) > dragon defender
- dragon boots > climbing boots
- barrows gloves > rune gloves
- no rune pouch
● Venenatis is weak to crush and will only use melee against you as long as you're in melee distance.
● Thralls are by far the most useful spell to take.
● At the start of the kill, Venenatis will move twice and then shoot the web special on the third attack. You should position yourself to place the web as close to the edge of the arena as possible without leaving melee distance of the boss. Run 4 tiles as it shoots the web to avoid it. Placing the web towards the edge of the arena lowers the chances of you getting dragged back into it when Venenatis moves around.
● After this first web despawns (20-30secs in a solo) Venenatis will move 1-2 more times before using the web special again. This ends up being about 50secs between web specials in a solo.
● Blood fury is extremely nice to use at this boss, you will profit supplies while using it allowing you to sit on maximum food in case pkers arrive.
● Don't worry about killing the spiderlings unless you're in a 4+ man team, in which case a couple of people should carry bulwarks (with lightbearers and death charge) and use specs to clear the spiderlings when they spawn in large waves.
